# Image-Captioning
Built a deep learning model that generates descriptive captions for images by integrating a CNN-based feature extractor with an LSTM-based language model. Utilized TensorFlow/Keras and trained on the Flickr8k dataset, showcasing proficiency in computer vision, sequence modeling, and end-to-end model deployment.
